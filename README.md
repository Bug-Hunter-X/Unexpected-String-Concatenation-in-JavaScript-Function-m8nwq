# Unexpected String Concatenation in JavaScript

This repository demonstrates a common, yet subtle, error in JavaScript: unexpected string concatenation. The `foo` function, intended to add two numbers, incorrectly concatenates a number and a string. 

The `bug.js` file shows the erroneous code, and `bugSolution.js` provides the corrected version.  This example highlights the importance of type checking and proper handling of different data types in JavaScript.
